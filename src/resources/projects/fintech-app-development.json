  "markdown": "## What\nMission-critical microservices for Astra Tech's ultra-app ecosystem (300M+ users), integrating remittance (international money transfer), referral systems, and backend infrastructure during a high-stakes merger of PayBy, Botim, and Rizek. Worked across two consecutive internships (2022-2023) during the $500M-funded transformation into the Middle East's first WeChat-style super-platform.\n\n## How\nBuilt production-grade microservices in Rust with Domain-Driven Design architecture. Implemented remittance service with real-time exchange rates, multi-currency support, and asynchronous processing via AMQP/RabbitMQ. Designed referral/loyalty system with Redis caching for campaign rules, fraud detection, and event-driven reward distribution. Applied DDD patterns: bounded contexts, aggregates, value objects, and domain events for complex financial domain modeling.\n\n## Result\nSuccessfully deployed remittance integration to production in Botim app and referral system driving viral growth. Handled thousands of transactions daily with horizontal scaling, memory-safe concurrent processing, and <1ms Redis lookups. Contributed to $500M M&A technical integration, supporting 300M+ user base across distributed team of 50+ engineers in 2 countries.\n\n### AI Usage (0%)\nNone. This work occurred in late 2022/early 2023 when LLMs were just emerging. Development focused on learning Domain-Driven Design principles, Rust's ownership/borrowing model through pair programming and code reviews, and enterprise-grade microservices architecture patterns through hands-on implementation and mentorship."
