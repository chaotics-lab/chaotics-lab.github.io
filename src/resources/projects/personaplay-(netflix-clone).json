Demonstrates comprehensive software engineering with MVC architecture, ORM patterns, and RESTful API integration.\n\n## How\nImplemented MVC architecture with JavaFX frontend (FXML layouts), Java backend using Hibernate ORM for MySQL database persistence, and OkHttp for external API integration. Built user authentication with BCrypt password hashing and SMTP email verification. Designed relational database schema with entities for users, videos, reviews, and forum posts. Created search system using Hibernate Criteria API with multi-criteria filtering (text, genre, year, rating) and pagination for performance.\n\n## Result\nProduction-ready desktop application with complete user account management, video catalog populated via external APIs, community forums with upvote system, star rating aggregation, and responsive grid-based UI. Successfully applied enterprise Java patterns (Hibernate, JPA, repository pattern) and multi-layer architecture across full stack from database design to user interface.\n\n### AI Usage (40%)\nCompleted shortly after a semester abroad Fullstack course using Spring/Springboot, with strong understanding of MVC, Hibernate, and Maven implementation patterns. AI assisted with code autocompletion, boilerplate generation (entity annotations, repository methods), test database population scripts, and documentation. All architectural decisions, UI design in JavaFX, database schema design, and core business logic were implemented manually."}
