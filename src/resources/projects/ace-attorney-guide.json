Solves the friction of navigating traditional wiki hierarchies during active gameplay by offering direct deep-linking to any game segment.\n\n## How\nBuilt using mdBook (Rust-based static site generator) to transform StrategyWiki content into an instantly accessible reference. Organized 6 mainline games plus spin-offs and crossovers with hierarchical link structure. Deployed via GitHub Pages with automatic CI/CD pipeline. Implemented mobile-first responsive design, tested using ngrok for real device validation during development.\n\n## Result\nA zero-latency reference tool with instant page loads and clean URL structure for bookmarking. Community-maintainable through GitHub PRs with Markdown source control. Successfully deployed with comprehensive coverage of the entire Ace Attorney series, including a play order chart for newcomers.\n\n### AI Usage (0%)\nNone. This is a static site generation project using existing documentation tools (mdBook) and community-sourced content from StrategyWiki, with manual content organization and deployment configuration."
