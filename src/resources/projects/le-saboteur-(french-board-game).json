  "markdown": "## What\nA digital adaptation of the French social deduction board game Saboteur, reimagined with wild-west pixel art theme. Players take hidden roles as gold miners or saboteurs, collaboratively building tunnel paths toward treasure while saboteurs secretly undermine progress through strategic path-building and sabotage mechanics.\n\n## How\nBuilt in C with Allegro 4 using procedural programming and manual memory management. Implemented path validation system with adjacency matrix for connection rules and flood-fill detection for dead ends. Designed turn-based multiplayer with hot-seat play, hidden role screens, and hand management. Created finite state machine for game phases (setup, playing, scoring) with mouse/keyboard input handling and double-buffered rendering for flicker-free graphics.\n\n## Result\nFull ruleset implementation supporting 3-10 players with strategic depth through deduction, bluffing, and path optimization. Created 50+ custom wild-west pixel art assets (card sprites, character avatars, UI elements) adapting the medieval theme. Demonstrated low-level C programming proficiency, 2D game development techniques, and modular architecture with separate rendering, logic, and input systems.\n\n### AI Usage (0%)\nNone. This project predates modern LLMs. All pixel art assets were hand-crafted, game logic implemented through manual C programming, and development relied on Allegro 4 documentation, memory debugging with valgrind, and iterative playtesting for game balance."}
