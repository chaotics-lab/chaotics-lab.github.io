Aircraft dynamically reroute around weather events while managing airport capacity constraints and collision avoidance.\n\n## How\nImplemented Dijkstra's algorithm for optimal pathfinding between airports, with real-time path recalculation when weather disables graph edges. Used finite state machines for aircraft behavior (taxiing, takeoff, cruising, landing) and spatial partitioning for efficient collision detection. Airport systems managed landing queues and runway allocation with FIFO scheduling. Event bus pattern broadcast route changes to affected aircraft for immediate rerouting.\n\n## Result\nFully functional simulation handling multiple simultaneous flights with autonomous navigation and dynamic adaptation. Demonstrated practical application of graph algorithms and OOP design patterns (State, Observer, Factory) in a real-time system. Achieved efficient performance through spatial indexing and algorithm optimization, reducing collision checks from O(n²) to O(n log n).\n\n### AI Usage (0%)\nNone. This project was completed as a computer science coursework assignment, implementing fundamental algorithms and design patterns through manual coding and architecture design. Art style and UI were completely designed by me, inspired by Animal Crossing: New Horizons."
