Reduced trajectory computation time from 17.31 seconds to <1ms per segment using machine learning.\n\n## How\nGenerated synthetic racing circuits and computed optimal baselines using minimum curvature algorithms based on vehicle dynamics. Designed and trained a feed-forward neural network on track/trajectory pairs, with input features of normal vectors and angular changes at track boundaries. Integrated real-time inference (<1ms) into ROS2 pipeline, receiving cone positions from perception and publishing waypoint commands to vehicle control.\n\n## Result\nProduction-ready system achieving real-time operation for competitive autonomous racing. Successfully replaced computationally expensive iterative optimization with neural network inference, validated through simulation and team integration. Created reusable synthetic track generation framework for training data augmentation as technical lead coordinating across Manufacturing, Perception, Trajectory, and DevOps teams.\n\n### AI Usage (40%)\nAI tools (like code assistants) were used for boilerplate code, formatting, scripting, and automation tasks. The core ML work (state-of-the-art trajectory optimization research, synthetic data generation pipeline, neural network architecture design, model training, and real-time inference implementation) was designed and developed by the team from scratch."
