  "markdown": "## What\nA 4-bit calculator implemented on an Intel DE10-Lite FPGA using VHDL, featuring IR remote input, signed/unsigned arithmetic operations, and multi-modal output including 7-segment displays, LEDs, and audible buzzer feedback.\n\n## How\nDecoded NEC protocol IR signals through a FSM for input handling. Implemented dual computation modes: internal VHDL arithmetic and external 74LS283 CLA adder integration via GPIO. Designed custom two's complement signed operation logic. Results displayed through 7-segment displays and buzzer output.\n\n## Result\nFully functional calculator supporting 8 operational modes across signed/unsigned and internal/external configurations. Validated through comprehensive testbenches and 37 documented physical test cases.\n\n### AI Usage (0%)\nNone. This project was completed in October 2021 as part of an electronics course at ECE Paris, prior to the availability of modern AI coding assistants."  }
