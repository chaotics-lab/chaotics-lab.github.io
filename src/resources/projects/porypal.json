Addresses GBA's tile-based rendering constraints (16-color palettes, 8×8 tile system, JASC-PAL format) that make batch sprite creation tedious and error-prone for ROM hackers working on decompilation projects.\n\n## How\nImplemented intelligent color quantization using CIEDE2000 perceptual color distance for 24-bit RGB → 4-bit indexed conversion with transparency slot enforcement. Built tile-based decomposition system with hash-based deduplication, flip/rotate operations, and interactive Qt GUI editor. Created YAML-driven batch processing pipeline supporting multiple output formats (C arrays, binary, assembly) with LZ77 compression, achieving 40-60% size reduction.\n\n## Result\n10x faster sprite conversion workflow with zero palette errors and ROM space savings through duplicate tile elimination. Adopted by Pokémon ROM hacking community (pokecommunity, r/PokemonROMhacks) and integrated into popular decompilation projects (pokeemerald, pokefirered). Enables batch processing of 100+ sprites in minutes, now used daily by known developers in the ROM hacking space.\n\n### AI Usage (60%)\nInitial proof-of-concept was fully AI-generated to validate feasibility. After seeing community interest, completely reimplemented from scratch following proper MVC architecture. AI assisted with specific GUI components in Qt (custom paint events, drag-and-drop tile rearrangement) and complex image processing functions I struggled with. Core architecture, domain logic for GBA constraints, and batch processing pipeline were manually designed and implemented."
