Navigates a 2m×3m arena to collect and stack containers on scoring craters within 90-second matches.\n\n## How\nESP8266 hosts HTML5/JavaScript web interface for real-time joystick control via AJAX (<10ms latency). Differential drive system uses PWM motor control with 8-directional zone detection for movement. Custom dual-jaw gripper actuated by SG90 servo through 3D-printed gear train designed in Tinkercad. Automated flag deployment at 90s via onboard timer triggered on first joystick input.\n\n## Result\nSuccessfully competed in 3 ECE-CUP tournaments with reliable autonomous operation. Achieved 100% flag deployment reliability, 120+ minute battery life, and zero disqualifications. Complete electromechanical system designed and integrated by 4-person team, rapid prototyping with 3D printing, and WiFi protocol implementation.\n\n### AI Usage (0%)\nNone. This project was completed in 2020-2021, before modern LLMs. Development relied on tutorial videos, ESP8266 documentation, trial-and-error iteration, and adapting existing examples through hands-on experimentation until achieving functional results."}
