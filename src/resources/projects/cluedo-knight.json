Players navigate interconnected caverns as iconic characters, deducing which character committed murder, with which weapon, and in which location through strategic interrogation and elimination—all rendered in custom pixel art faithful to the game's monochromatic aesthetic.\n\n## How\nBuilt in C++ with Allegro 4 using OOP design patterns (State, Observer, Factory, Strategy). Implemented graph-based board navigation, dice roll mechanics, and secret passages. Developed AI opponents using Bayesian inference probability matrices and knowledge tracking across game history. Created full Cluedo ruleset with 216 possible solution combinations (6 characters × 6 weapons × 9 locations) supporting 3-6 players.\n\n## Result\nComplete game loop with atmospheric presentation faithful to Hollow Knight's tone. Successfully adapted Victorian mansion mystery to dark fantasy setting through hand-crafted pixel art (50+ hours): character sprites with animations, weapon icons, location backgrounds, and UI merging detective aesthetics with minimalist design. Demonstrated mastery of game AI, state machines, and 2D rendering pipeline.\n\n### AI Usage (0%)\nNone. This project predates modern LLMs. All pixel art assets (sprites, backgrounds, UI elements) were hand-drawn from scratch over 50+ hours, inspired by Hollow Knight's visual style. Programming followed Allegro 4 documentation and OOP principles through manual implementation."
