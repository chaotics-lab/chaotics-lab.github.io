Provides persistent visual progress indicators without user accounts or external servers, using browser local storage for privacy-focused tracking.\n\n## How\nContent script injection monitors YouTube's SPA navigation via MutationObserver and detects video completion through dual triggers: natural ending events and 90% threshold with continuous watch time validation. Batch storage reads fetch all tracking data in single call, using IntersectionObserver for virtual scrolling to render progress bars only for visible playlist items. Extracts playlist metadata through CSS selector chains and regex parsing of YouTube's dynamically generated HTML.\n\n### AI Usage (100%)\nThis was a 2-hour experiment testing Claude Code (via Atlassian's Rovodev at the time) capabilities for rapid prototyping. Wanted a personal tool for tracking music playlists and course progress on YouTube but dislike frontend/web development. Entire extension generated through copy-pasting and yelling at the AI's outputs; architecture, DOM manipulation, storage logic, performance optimizations. Miserable experience workflow-wise, but functional result validated AI's capability for throwaway utility tools. Great tool I never made."
