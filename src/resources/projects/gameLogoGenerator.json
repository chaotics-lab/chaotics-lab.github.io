  "markdown": "## What\nA streamlined web application used to produce uniform, high quality game icons for my upcoming cross-platform retro emulation frontend Kioku (きおく), inspired by the iiSU project.\n\n## How\nThe tool takes a source image, applies a consistent border, color gradient, and system icon either from pre-existing templates or custom-made ones, previews the icon in context, and exports ready to use. It ensures each asset aligns within the layout.\n\n## Result\nA fast and reliable workflow for generating cohesive game visuals. Every title in Kioku uses this tool for a clean, unified presentation of the user’s game library that improves readability, navigation, and overall frontend polish."
